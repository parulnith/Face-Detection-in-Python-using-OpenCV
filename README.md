[Face Detection with Python using OpenCV](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/face-detection-with-python-using-opencv-5c27e521c19a)
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

## Objective
This is the repository linked to the tutorial with the same name. The idea is to introduce people to the concept of object detection in Python using the OpenCV library and how it can be utilized to perform tasks like Facial detection.
